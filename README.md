# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

## Project Description

This project implements the back-end server for the WTWR (What to Wear?) application.  
It provides a RESTful API to manage users and clothing items, with MongoDB as the database.  
The server is built with Express.js, and features basic user authorization middleware.

The goal of this project is to develop hands-on experience in:

- Setting up an Express.js server
- Integrating with MongoDB using Mongoose
- Implementing temporary user authorization
- Handling errors and status codes properly
- Preparing for server deployment

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js** — Web application framework
- **MongoDB** — NoSQL database
- **Mongoose** — MongoDB object modeling tool
- **ESLint** — JavaScript linter for code consistency
- **Prettier** — Code formatter
- **GitHub Actions** — For automated testing
- **Nodemon** — Auto-restart development server
- **Validator** — Data validation library

## Running the Project

- `npm run start` — launches the server
- `npm run dev` — launches the server with hot reloading

## Testing

Before committing your code, edit the `sprint.txt` file in the root folder and input your current sprint number (e.g., 12 or 13).  
This ensures the correct test suite is selected during automated GitHub Actions testing.
